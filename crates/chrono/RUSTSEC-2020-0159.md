# Potential segfault in `localtime_r` invocations

### Impact

Unix-like operating systems may segfault due to dereferencing a dangling pointer in specific circumstances. This requires an environment variable to be set in a different thread than the affected functions. This may occur without the user's knowledge, notably in a third-party library.

### Workarounds

A possible workaround for crates affected through the transitive dependency in `chrono`, is to avoid using the default `oldtime` feature dependency of the `chrono` crate by disabling its `default-features` and manually specifying the required features instead.

#### Examples:

`Cargo.toml`:  

```toml
chrono = { version = "0.4", default-features = false, features = ["serde"] }
```

```toml
chrono = { version = "0.4.22", default-features = false, features = ["clock"] }
```

Commandline:  

```bash
cargo add chrono --no-default-features -F clock
```
